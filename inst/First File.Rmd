# Intro

Often you'll want to arrange multiple {ggplot2} charts together with tags and titles, eg:

```{r create-gg_ptch_chart, echo=FALSE}
ptchw_chart <- ( ( gg_penguin_scatter | gg_penguin_bar_chart ) + plot_layout(tag_level = 'new') ) / gg_penguins_timeline + plot_layout(guides = 'collect') 
gg_ptch_chart <- ptchw_chart &
  guides(color = guide_none()) &
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = c('1', 'a'), tag_sep = ".") &
  plot_annotation(title = "Arranging ggplot2 charts") &
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("gg_ptch_chart.png",
       gg_ptch_chart)
gg_ptch_chart


```
There are two different packages you can choose from, {cowplot} and {patchwork}. They are both very popular in the R community and it's almost down to personal choice which one you prefer. I've tried to differentiate them a little bit:

- {cowplot}

  - Charts are explicitly built within a grid using `plot_grid()`. The layout is controlled by specifying the number of rows and columns in the chart
  
  - Nested `plot_grid()` are required to get a single chart to span multiple rows or columns.
  
  - Themes need to be applied to individual charts.
  
  - Legends need to be extracted from charts and manually placed within a `plot_grid()`.
  
> {cowplot} allows extreme precision over your charts. Complex collections of charts with inset charts and custom looking legends can be created.
  
  
- {patchwork}

  - Charts are built using `(p1 + p2) / p3` syntax, `p3` will be placed under `p1` and `p2`.
  
  - Because there is no grid system `p3` will automatically span the entire width of the chart.
  
  - Themes can be applied to the entire patchwork chart.
  
  - Legends can be automatically collected.
  
> {patchwork} feels and behaves like a ggplot2 extension, a lot of things are automated. It can become painful to create extremely customised charts.


## cowplot

We need to create a nested plot_grid() for the timeline chart to span the width of the chart:


```{r create-Plot_grid}
plot_grid(plot_grid(gg_penguin_scatter, gg_penguin_bar_chart),
          plot_grid(gg_penguins_timeline),
          nrow = 2)
```

In the chart below our goal is to collect together the legends and change the theme:

- The legend is extracted from the bar chart with `get_legend()`

- The legends for all charts are disabled with `theme(legend.position = "none")`

- The legend is attached to the chart using another `plot_grid()`

- The theme has to be changed for all individual charts.
